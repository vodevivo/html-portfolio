<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, <br/><br/>

  My name is Ivo Vodev and I'm a web developer.
</p>

<p>  For the past 10 years I have been working
  with customers in a few different scopes,
  thanks to which I learned to be more
  communicative, organized and with good
  level of self-confidence. On my current
  position I managed to develop skills
  regarding the responsibility in the
  assignments, good sense of time management
  and performance under pressure to meet the
  deadlines. I’m good in dealing my
  assignments by myself, as well as working in
  a team.</p>

<p>Lately, I decided that it’s time to make a turn
  in my career and referred to the Front-End
  development, as I have always been
  interested in the user experience and design
  sphere.
  In the last year I have passed several
  academic courses in JavaScript, HTML and
  CSS, as well as in the QA testing.
  My experience in the sphere is basic and non-
  company level, so I’m seeking for making a
  professional debut and develop my skills in
  that direction as a Junior web developer.</p>
